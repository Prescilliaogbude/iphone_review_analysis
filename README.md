## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of iPhone reviews scraped from Amazon. It contains various information such as review text, ratings, and potentially other metadata.


## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the reviews and identify trends over time or across different iPhone models.
- **Feature Analysis:** Analyze user satisfaction with specific features of the iPhone (e.g., camera, battery life, performance).
- **Topic Modeling:** Discover underlying themes and discussion points in the reviews using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

## Methodology

The project employs the following methodology:

1. **Data Collection:** (If applicable) Briefly describe how the data was collected or obtained.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the text data for analysis. This includes:
    - Removing irrelevant characters and punctuation.
    - Tokenization (splitting text into words).
    - Stop word removal.
    - Stemming or lemmatization.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize libraries like TextBlob or VADER to determine the sentiment of each review. Aggregate the results to understand overall sentiment and trends.
4. **Feature Analysis:** Identify mentions of specific features in the reviews and analyze the sentiment associated with those mentions.
5. **Topic Modeling:** Apply LDA or other topic modeling techniques to discover underlying themes and group reviews based on these themes.
6. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to present the findings, such as sentiment distribution charts, feature satisfaction graphs, and word clouds for topics.
